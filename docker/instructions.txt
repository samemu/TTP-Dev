DOCKER INSTRUCTIONS
-- SETUP --
This system uses two docker images - one for the host, the other for clients.
rkalvait/blr is the image for the client
rkalvait/host is the image for the host
If there are any issues using these images, you may build your own 
from this directory to create a client image, or the ./host/ subdirectory
for the host image.

These images run on a subnet I have named smartnet. This subnet must be
set up ahead of time using the following command:

sudo docker network create --subnet=172.18.0.0/16 smartnet

This is to maintain a static IP address or the host and allow communication
between the containers.

Once this has been set up, you can run the start script

-- RUNNING --

To start the system, simply run net_test.sh
This will instantiate one host and a number of clients equal to the number
of columns in the file data.csv. To test, run bash within the host client
and read the contents of datalog.txt. It should contain data from a few 
different IPs.

-- TODO --

Separate data files for each client
More images for different types of cients (e.g. dorm, lab, office, etc.)
Unique data per client (currently all clients have identical data sets)
 - each client should have one unique column from data.csv
Any additional features as requested by Dr. Tout or Michalis
